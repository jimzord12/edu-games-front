# Mini Games ðŸ§©

## Objective

You need to place electromagnets in the right positions (_or drag the electromagnets depending on the level_) to guide the ball through the maze and reach the exit.

The ball will be affected by the magnetic fields created by the magnets, so you need to think carefully about where to place them.

## What benefits do Electromagnets have over simple Magnets?

Electromagnets can:

- be turned on and off,
- their strength can be adjusted by changing the current flowing through the wire.
- Its also very easy to change their polarity. Just reverse the current direction.

## Sadly the Game is not hosted online just yet! ðŸ˜“

But, you can download it from GitHub and run it locally!

Follow the instructions in the README file to set up the game on your local machine.
