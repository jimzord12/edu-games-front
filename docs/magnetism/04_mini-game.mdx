# Mini Games ðŸ§©

## Objective

You need to place magnets in the right positions (_or drag the magnets depending on the level_) to guide the ball through the maze and reach the exit.

The ball will be affected by the magnetic fields created by the magnets, so you need to think carefully about where to place them.

## Sadly the Game is not hosted online just yet! ðŸ˜“

But, you can download it from GitHub and run it locally!

Follow the instructions in the README file to set up the game on your local machine.

Here is the link to the repository:
