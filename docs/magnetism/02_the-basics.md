# Magnetism: The Basics! 🧲✨

## The Laws of Magnetic Poles

Every magnet has two ends, called **poles**:

- **North Pole (N)**
- **South Pole (S)**

The rule of magnetism is simple:

- **Opposite poles attract!** 🧲 **(North to South, South to North)**
- **Same poles repel!** 🚫 **(North to North, South to South)**

## What happens when cut a magnet is half?



If you bring two magnets close together, they will either **stick to each other or push away** depending on which poles are facing.

## Magnetic Fields: The Invisible Power!

Magnets create an invisible area of force around them called a **magnetic field**. This field is what allows a magnet to work **even without touching an object**. You can see this field by sprinkling **iron filings** around a magnet—they will line up in cool patterns that show the magnetic force!

## Fun Facts About Magnets! 🤩

- **Earth is a giant magnet!** 🌍 The Earth's core is made of molten iron, which creates a huge magnetic field. This is why **compasses always point North!**
- **Some animals use magnetism to navigate!** 🐦 Birds, sea turtles, and even some fish have tiny magnets in their bodies that help them find their way during long journeys.
- **Magnets are used everywhere!** 🚆 You can find magnets in **fridge doors, speakers, credit cards, MRI machines, and even high-speed Maglev trains!**
