# Magnetism Glossary

## A

Attract – When two objects pull toward each other, like a magnet pulling a paperclip.

## B

Bar Magnet – A simple rectangular magnet with a north and south pole.

## C

Compass – A tool with a magnetized needle that points north.

## F

Field Lines – Invisible lines that show the direction and strength of a magnetic field.

Force (Magnetic) – The push or pull a magnet applies to objects.

## G

Geomagnetic Field – Earth’s natural magnetic field.

## H

Horseshoe Magnet – A magnet shaped like a horseshoe that is strong at both ends.

## I

Iron – A metal that magnets stick to.

## L

Lodestone – A naturally occurring magnet.

## M

Maglev (Magnetic Levitation) – A technology that makes objects float using magnets, like some trains.

Magnet – An object that creates an invisible force field and attracts iron.

Magnetic Field – The invisible area around a magnet where it has power.

Magnetic Pole – The ends of a magnet (north and south).

Magnetism – The force that makes magnets attract or repel things.

## N

North Pole (Magnetic) – The end of a magnet that points north.

Non-Magnetic Material – A material that magnets do not stick to (like plastic or wood).

## O

Opposite Poles – The north and south ends of a magnet; they attract each other.

## R

Repel – When two like poles (north-north or south-south) push away from each other.

## S

South Pole (Magnetic) – The end of a magnet that points south.

## T

Tesla (T) – The unit used to measure magnetic strength.
