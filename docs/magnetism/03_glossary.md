# Magnetism & Electromagnetism Glossary

## A

Attract – When two objects pull toward each other, like a magnet pulling a paperclip.

Ampere (A) – The unit of electric current (how much electricity is flowing).

## B

Bar Magnet – A simple rectangular magnet with a north and south pole.

Battery – A device that provides electricity to power circuits.

Biot-Savart Law – A rule that explains how electric currents create magnetic fields (advanced).

Buzzer – A small device that makes sound using electricity and magnetism.

## C

Compass – A tool with a magnetized needle that points north.

Conductor – A material that allows electricity to flow through it (like copper wires).

Coil – A looped wire that creates a magnetic field when electricity flows through it.

## D

Dynamo – A small generator that produces electricity using motion.

## E

Electricity – The movement of tiny particles (electrons) that creates power.

Electromagnet – A magnet that works only when electricity is flowing through it.

Electromagnetic Induction – The process of making electricity using magnets and motion.

Electromagnetic Waves – Invisible energy waves (like light, radio, and X-rays) that travel through space.

Electron – A tiny particle that carries electricity and moves inside atoms.

## F

Faraday’s Law – A rule that explains how changing a magnetic field can create electricity.

Field Lines – Invisible lines that show the direction and strength of a magnetic field.

Force (Magnetic) – The push or pull a magnet applies to objects.

## G

Generator – A machine that makes electricity using magnets and motion.

Geomagnetic Field – Earth’s natural magnetic field.

## H

Hans Christian Ørsted – The scientist who discovered that electricity creates magnetism.

Horseshoe Magnet – A magnet shaped like a horseshoe that is strong at both ends.

## I

Insulator – A material that does NOT allow electricity to flow through it (like plastic or rubber).

Iron – A metal that magnets stick to.

## L

Lodestone – A naturally occurring magnet.

Lorentz Force – The force that moves a charged particle when it enters a magnetic field.

## M

Maglev (Magnetic Levitation) – A technology that makes objects float using magnets, like some trains.

Magnet – An object that creates an invisible force field and attracts iron.

Magnetic Field – The invisible area around a magnet where it has power.

Magnetic Pole – The ends of a magnet (north and south).

Magnetism – The force that makes magnets attract or repel things.

Motor (Electric) – A device that turns electricity into motion using magnets.

## N

North Pole (Magnetic) – The end of a magnet that points north.

Non-Magnetic Material – A material that magnets do not stick to (like plastic or wood).

## O

Opposite Poles – The north and south ends of a magnet; they attract each other.

## R

Repel – When two like poles (north-north or south-south) push away from each other.

## S

Solenoid – A coil of wire that makes a magnetic field when electricity flows through it.

South Pole (Magnetic) – The end of a magnet that points south.

Static Electricity – A type of electricity that doesn’t flow, like when you rub a balloon on your hair.

Superconductor – A special material that lets electricity flow without resistance (advanced).

## T

Tesla (T) – The unit used to measure magnetic strength.

Transformer – A device that changes electricity from one voltage to another.

Turbine – A machine that spins to help generate electricity.

## W

Wire – A thin metal thread that carries electricity.
